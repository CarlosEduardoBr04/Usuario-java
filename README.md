## Java User Class Project 🚀

### Description 📝

This project is a practical exercise, serving as a personal challenge to test and apply my Java knowledge. It involves the implementation of a Java class named `Usuario` designed to represent user information, including name, login, and password.

### Key Features 🛠️

- **Constructors:**
  - `public Usuario()`: Initializes a `Usuario` object with empty values for name, login, and password.
  - `public Usuario(String nome, String login, String senha)`: Allows the creation of a `Usuario` object with specific values.

- **Encapsulation:**
  - Getter and setter methods to access and modify attributes (name, login, password).

- **`Mensagem` Method:**
  - `public void Mensagem()`: Displays a message with the current attribute values.

### Usage 🚀

Clone this repository to incorporate the `Usuario` class into your Java project. Use the encapsulated constructors and methods to efficiently manage user information.
